# scaleGMRF

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

scaleGMRF is a package that provides useful functions to standardize Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) effects used in Latent Gaussian models.

The reason to standardize GMRF effects is to guarantee that their scale parameters match their intuitive interpretation, defined as the
variance contribution of the effects as intended by the user. This is important to correctly reflect prior information about the variance contributions of the different effects of Latent Gaussian models through prior specification on the scale parameters.

The package also contains functions to specify a modified
version of P-Spline effects (either in one or two dimensions).

A working paper about the new tools implemented in this package is under development.

## Installation

You can install the scaleGMRF package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LFerrariIt/scaleGMRF")
```
