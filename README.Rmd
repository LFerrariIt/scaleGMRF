# scaleGMRF

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

scaleGMRF is a package that provides useful functions to standardize Gaussian Markov Random Fields effects  used in Latent Gaussian models. The standardization guarantees that the corresponding scale parameters of the effects match their intuitive interpretation defined as the variance contribution of the effect as intended by the user. Additionally, the package also contains function to define the modified version of P-Spline effects: specifically, unidimensional P-Spline effects of first- and second-order, and two-dimensional P-Splines of first-order.

## Installation

You can install the development version of scaleGMRF from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
      
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LFerrariIt/scaleGMRF")
```

##How to write README

The goal of the README is to answer the following questions about your package:

Why should I use it?
How do I use it?
How do I get it?

When you write your README, try to put yourself in the shoes of someone whoâ€™s come across your package and is trying to figure out if it solves a problem they have. If they decide that your package looks promising, the README should also show them how to install it and how to do one or two basic tasks. 

A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.

An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.

An overview that describes the main components of the package. Point to vignettes for more details. This is also a good place to describe how your package fits into the ecosystem of its target domain.
