\title{Standardized cluster effect}
\usage{
iid_standard(x, fixed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An ordered factor, with more than 1 level.}

\item{fixed}{Logical, indicating whether the effect must be treated as fixed (TRUE) or random (FALSE). If it is treated as fixed, a 0 mean constraint is imposed By default, TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list of 6 elements, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{precision}: precision matrix
\item \code{basis}:  basis matrix evaluated at \code{x}
\item \code{scaling_constant}: a positive number, representing the appropriate scaling constant
\item \code{null_space}: a matrix, representing the null space of the precision matrix
\item \code{X_distribution}: a numeric vector of values sampled from the Uniform distribution of X
\item \code{basis_distribution}: basis matrix evaluated at \code{X_distribution}
}
}
